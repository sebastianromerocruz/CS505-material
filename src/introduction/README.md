### Part 1: _Character Stats_

Hey, my name is Sebastián, and my last names are Romero Cruz (not just Cruz, contrary to Pace's system). I teach about 
programming for a living and, incredibly, sometimes even enjoy programming itself.

This is my first semester teaching this class at Pace University, but I have been teaching at the university level since
January 2020, making this my fifth semester as an instructor. I'm actually very excited to teach this class; I love 
Java, and haven't had the chance to use it for a while, so this is the perfect opportunity for both you and I to learn 
together.

Here's how you can reach me if you have any questions:

| **Email**                              | **Office Hours**                                                      |

Unless you have a super trivial question, **I much prefer you scheduling office hours with me to ask me questions about
the course**. Even if we only spend 5 minutes on a Zoom call, it is a lot easier for me to keep track of my calendar 
this way, and a lot harder for me to lose track of your e-mail (something I am unfortunately wont to do).

Anyway, other things I enjoy are:

- **Slice of life anime**: my favourite is [***Hibike! Euphonium***](https://youtu.be/Cb9OAuquKaI)
- **French history**: anything starting with the French Revolution of 1789 to the end of the de Gaulle presidency in 1969. 
- **Literature**: my current favourite is [***Paris is a Party, Paris is a Ghost***](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374722494).
- **Playing music**: I play a [**Rickenbacker 4001C64**](http://www.rickenbacker.com/model.asp?model=4001C64).

That's all I want to flex at the present moment. Let's talk about the course.

### Part 2: _Course Prerequisites_

The single prerequisite course for success of non-CS college graduates in MS in CS/SDE by effective hands-on 
introduction to computational thinking and Java programming based on the Pace University unique VM-empowered Seidenberg 
Portal Lab that enables students to practice programming anywhere anytime.

That being said, if there is anything at all that you don't understand, or would like to know more about, **please raise
your hand**. Believe it or not, the more questions you ask, the more **I** learn. Not just about the types of things 
that I may not be explaining correctly, but about the material itself as well. The best way to learn something is to 
teach it to somebody else. So I encourage all of you to raise your hand and ask as many questions as possible. The more 
you challenge my knowledge on the language with questions, the more we will learn as a class, and the better your grades
will be.

Java can be a rather complicated language, and the topics that we will be covering this semester are on the tricky side,
so let's make sure that we're all on the same page as much as possible.

### Part 3: _Course Overview_

Speaking of topics, these are the ones that we will be covering throughout the semester:

- Data modeling with primitive data types
- Single / multi-dimensional arrays
- Classes and packages
- Computation algorithm specification with expressions, assignments, conditional & loop statements, and method
- Formatted data I/O on the console and through files
- Software reuse with class inheritance
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Problem-solving with Java collection framework data types stack, queue, Vector and Ηashtable
- Basic sorting and searching algorithms
- Basic graphic user interface programming based on event-driven programming

### Part 4: _Textbook_

Speaking of catching up, the textbook that I will be pulling heavily from is the following:

> ***Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, Comprehensive Version, Student Value Edition Plus MyLab 
> Programming with Pearson eText - Access Card Package 12th Edition”,*** Y. Daniel Liang, 2017, Pearson, ISBN 
> 9780136519355

You can get this textbook via the Pace bookstore. ***Do not get the MyLab Pearson course ID***.

### Part 5: _Course Structure_

- **Programming Projects**: 60%
- **Quizzes**: 20%
- **Attendance**: 20%

### Part 6: _Integrity_

While you are encouraged to study together, **everything that you submit for credit must be your own work**. If an
instance of cheating is discovered, everyone involved will get a 0 for that lab/assignment/exam. Second offenders will
get an **F** for the course assigned.

Please don't make me do any of that; I have given failing grades due to plagiarism before and it breaks my heart every
single time. If you're struggling with a programming assignment, please ask me or the Seidenberg tutors for help.
