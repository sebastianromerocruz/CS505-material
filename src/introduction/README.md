### Part 1: _Character Stats_

Hey, my name is Sebastián, and my last names are Romero Cruz (not just Cruz, contrary to Pace's system). I teach about 
programming for a living and, incredibly, sometimes even enjoy programming itself.

This is my first semester teaching this class at Pace University, but I have been teaching at the university level since
January 2020, making this my fifth semester as an instructor. I'm actually very excited to teach this class; I love 
Java, and haven't had the chance to use it for a while, so this is the perfect opportunity for both you and I to learn 
together.

Here's how you can reach me if you have any questions:

| **Email**                              | **Office Hours**                                                      |

Unless you have a super trivial question, **I much prefer you scheduling office hours with me to ask me questions about
the course**. Even if we only spend 5 minutes on a Zoom call, it is a lot easier for me to keep track of my calendar 
this way, and a lot harder for me to lose track of your e-mail (something I am unfortunately wont to do).

Anyway, other things I enjoy are:

- **Slice of life anime**: my favourite is [***Hibike! Euphonium***](https://youtu.be/Cb9OAuquKaI)
- **French history**: anything starting with the French Revolution of 1789 to the end of the de Gaulle presidency in 1969. 
- **Literature**: my current favourite is [***Paris is a Party, Paris is a Ghost***](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374722494).
- **Playing music**: I play a [**Rickenbacker 4001C64**](http://www.rickenbacker.com/model.asp?model=4001C64).

That's all I want to flex at the present moment. Let's talk about the course.

### Part 2: _Course Prerequisites_

You must, ostensibly, have a minimum grade of **C in CS121** in order to take CS122, this class. If this is not the case
for you, please speak to your advisor as soon as possible so that you can switch to a different course plan.

That being said, it has been a long break, and we are all liable to forget material. So, if you feel that your CS121
foundation is not as solid as you would like it to be, please feel free to go through the textbook and review the 
material.

More importantly, if there is anything at all that you don't understand, or would like to know more about, **please 
raise your hand**. Believe it or not, the more questions you ask, the more **I** learn. Not just about the types of
things that I may not be explaining correctly, but about the material itself as well. The best way to learn something
is to teach it to somebody else. So I encourage all of you to raise your hand and ask as many questions as possible.
The more you challenge my knowledge on the language with questions, the more we will learn as a class, and the better 
your grades will be.

Java can be a rather complicated language, and the topics that we will be covering this semester are on the tricky side,
so let's make sure that we're all on the same page as much as possible.

### Part 3: _Course Overview_

Speaking of topics, these are the ones that we will be covering throughout the semester:

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Exception handling
- Recursion
- Linked-lists
- Multi-threading and thread synchronisation
- GUI Design

Recursion and multi-threading, in particular, are famously difficult topics for beginners, so please don't delay in 
asking your questions and/or catch up on the easier topics as soon as possible.

### Part 4: _Textbook_

Speaking of catching up, the textbook that I will be pulling heavily from is the following:

> ***Java Software Solutions***, Lewis and Loftus, Addison-Wesley, 9th Edition ISBN 9780134462028

You can get this textbook via the Pace bookstore. ***Do not get the MyLab Pearson course ID***.

### Part 5: _Course Structure_

- **Programming Projects**: 20%
- **Writing Assignments**: 10%
- **Lab Assignments**: 10%
- **Midterm Exams (2)**: 25% (12.5% each)
- **Final Exam**: 20%
- **Quizzes**: 10%
- **Attendance**: 5%

#### 5.1: _Assignments_

We have two types of assignments throughout the semester:

1. **Writing**: A few questions related to the material discussed in class; taken from the textbook.
2. **Programming**: 6 programming projects, each due at 11:59pm on the due date. Late submissions are accepted up to 
two days late, with 15% point deduction each day late.

One late programming project will have its late penalty removed at the end of the semester—use this gift strategically.

#### 5.2: _Labs_

Following each lecture, you will be assigned a few programming problems to complete before our class period is over.
You can, and are encouraged to, both collaborate with you classmates and to ask me questions. However, the work you
submit must be entirely your own.

**If you do not finish within the class time, the lab becomes homework by default.** You must show me the finished lab 
by the next lab section to earn full credit.

#### 5.3: _Exams & Quizzes_

- **Two Midterm Exams**: Entire two-hour period; contains a paper test and a programming test.
- **One Final Exam**: Cumulative, paper-only.
- **Quizzes**: Assigned at the end of each lecture, testing your understanding of the basics. Naturally, you will need
to pay attention to do well in them. These *will* be counted towards your final grade.

### Part 6: _Integrity_

While you are encouraged to study together, **everything that you submit for credit must be your own work**. If an
instance of cheating is discovered, everyone involved will get a 0 for that lab/assignment/exam. Second offenders will
get an **F** for the course assigned.

Please don't make me do any of that; I have given failing grades due to plagiarism before and it breaks my heart every
single time. If you're struggling with a programming assignment, please ask me or the Seidenberg tutors for help.
