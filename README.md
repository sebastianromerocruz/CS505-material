### _Class Information_

- **Pre-Requisites**: None.
- **Credits**: 3.
- **Function**: Prerequisite for MS in Computer Science and MS in Software Development & Engineering.

### _Description_

This course covers the fundamental concepts and methods of Object-Oriented problem-solving using Java as the programming
language. 

The main topics include data modeling with primitive data types, single/multi-dimensional arrays, classes and packages;
computation algorithm specification with expressions, assignments, conditional & loop statements, and methods; formatted
data I/O on the console and through files; software reuse with class inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism; 
problem-solving with Java collection framework data types stack, queue, Vector and Ηashtable; basic sorting and 
searching algorithms; and basic graphic user interface programming based on event-driven programming.

### _Objectives_

The single prerequisite course for success of non-CS college graduates in MS in CS/SDE by effective hands-on 
introduction to computational thinking and Java programming based on the Pace University unique VM-empowered Seidenberg
Portal Lab that enables students to practice programming anywhere anytime.

### _University Policies and Resources_

#### Academic Integrity

Students in this course are required to adhere to Pace University's Academic Integrity Code. The Academic Integrity Code
supports honesty and ethical conduct in the educational process. It educates students about what constitutes academic 
misconduct, helps to deter cheating and plagiarism, and provides a procedure for handling cases of academic misconduct. 
Students are expected to be familiar with the Code, which can be found under "University Policies" in the [**student 
handbook**](https://www.pace.edu/student-handbook). Individual schools and programs may have additional standards of 
academic integrity. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the policies of the schools, programs, 
and courses in which they are enrolled.

Instructions for faculty, a paper about best practices, and the form for reporting integrity policy violations are 
posted on the [**Provost's webpage under policies and 
forms**](https://www.pace.edu/provost/academic-policies-and-forms). Reporting forms should be sent to the Chairs of the
Academic Conduct Committee on each campus.

#### Learning Centers

[**The Learning Center**](https://www.pace.edu/learning-commons/current-students) uses an array of programs and a 
holistic approach to assist students with academic skills and content knowledge. We are dedicated to developing 
independent learners by creating purposeful interactions with trained, well-qualified peer and professional staff.

#### Technological Resources

- [**Pace Information Technology Services**](https://www.pace.edu/its)
- For assistance with a technological concern (Blackboard, Internet, Computer, etc.), contact the Pace Helpdesk at 
**914-773-3648** or create a help desk ticket.
- [**Learning Remotely website**](https://www.pace.edu/its/its-service-areas/all-services/working-remotely)

### _Appropriate Use Policy for Information Technology_

Pace endorses the following statement on software and intellectual rights distributed by EDUCAUSE, the non-profit 
consortium of colleges and universities, committed to the use and management of information technology in higher 
education. The statement reads:

> Respect for intellectual labor and creativity is vital to academic discourse and enterprise. This principle applies to
> work of all authors and publishers in all media. It encompasses respect for the right to acknowledgment, right to 
> privacy and right to determine the form, manner and terms of publication and distribution.
> 
> Because electronic information is volatile and easily reproduced, respect for the work and personal expression of 
> others is especially critical in computer environments. Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism, 
> invasion of privacy, unauthorized access and trade secret and copyright violations, may be grounds for sanctions 
> against members of the academic community.

Pace’s appropriate use policy applies to recordings of classroom instruction and digital artifacts created by faculty 
and students.

### _Procedure for Students with Disabilities Who Wish to Obtain Reasonable Accommodations for a Course_

The University's commitment to equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities includes providing 
reasonable accommodations for the needs of students with disabilities. 

To request reasonable accommodation for a 
qualified disability a student with a disability must self-identify and register with Student Accessibility Services for
his or her campus. No one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need for or grant a request for 
accommodation except Student Accessibility Services. Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact 
Student Accessibility Services on behalf of a student. For further information, please see [**Resources for Students 
with Disabilities page**](https://www.pace.edu/counseling/student-accessibility-services).

### _Sex-Based Misconduct Policy and Procedure_

Pace University is committed to providing a safe environment for every member of its community and to ensuring that no 
student, faculty or staff member is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of any University program or 
activity on the basis of sex. Accordingly, the University prohibits the following forms of Sex-Based Misconduct: sexual 
assault, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual exploitation and 
stalking.

You should be aware I am a non-confidential resource and have an obligation to report any information about sexual 
assault with the University’s Title IX/Affirmative Action Officer, Ms. Lisa Miles (163 Williams Street, Room 1017, 
212-346-1310, [**amiles@pace.edu**](mailto:amiles@pace.edu)). The Title IX/Affirmative Action Office is responsible for 
investigating violations of the sexual misconduct policy. For more information about the Pace University sexual 
misconduct policy, see the [**Sex-Based Misconduct Policy and Procedure 
(PDF)**](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/security-emergency-management/fire-safety-security-report/sex-based-and-non-sex-based-misconduct-policy.pdf).

Members of the University community who believe that they have been subjected to Sex-Based Misconduct are encouraged to 
report such incidents to the University and, where applicable, to local law enforcement. **Confidential** resources 
include the **University Counseling Centers, Offices of Sexual and Interpersonal Wellness** and **University 
Healthcare**. Contact information for those offices may be found in the self-care section below.

### _Self-Care_

Your academic success in this course and throughout your college career depends heavily on your personal health and 
well-being. Stress is a common part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected life changes
outside the classroom. The Pace Community strongly encourages you to take care of yourself throughout the term, before 
the demands of midterms and finals reach their peak. Please feel free to talk with me about any difficulty you may be 
having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. Please 
know there are a number of other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you. I strongly encourage you to 
contact them when needed.
